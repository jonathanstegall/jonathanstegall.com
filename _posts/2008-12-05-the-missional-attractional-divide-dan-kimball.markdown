> I say we live in a post-Christendom context, but here’s a point that doesn’t get mentioned: Christendom, like modernity itself, isn’t gone. It’s still alive and well in its own context, and in those contexts it doesn’t appear that it’s going anywhere anytime soon. That’s why attractional churches still work… just not in every context or with every people group. There are some people groups who are repelled by it.
