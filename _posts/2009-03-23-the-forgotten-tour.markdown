Some friends of mine are involved in the Atlanta stop of a tour called <a href="http://www.makinghimfamous.net/2009/03/remedy-for-this-heart-the-forgotten-tour-and-a-catalyst-for-awareness/">The Forgotten Tour</a>, which is coming to <a href="http://dannemans.com/wordpress/">Danneman's Coffee</a>.

Essentially, it is an event designed to raise awareness, and something about, homelessness on an individual level. One of the speakers has been homeless for 13 years, and any donations or merchandise proceeds will go to him. There is <a href="http://vimeo.com/2555107">a video</a> with more information about the event.

Now: I'm not privy to any other specific information about the tour, or what is hoped for beyond the tour, or anything like that. But regardless: there is <a href="http://www.twloha.com/">great potential</a> for activism that starts out as a small venture to meet a specific need. Shane Claiborne seems to be fond of saying, "Get ready for something really, really... small."
