> How many hours a day do you sit in front of a keyboard and screen? When you cook, it gives you something to do with your hands that doesnâ€™t involve a smartphone. When you cook, it gets you away from your computer and hyperconnectedness, if just for a moment, and forces you to do something primal, something humans have done for eons. And when you switch modes like that, when you disconnect even for twenty minutes, it gives your brain some room to think.
