> We&rsquo;re better connected than we&rsquo;ve ever been, but we&rsquo;re not always connected. ApplicationCache lets users interact with their data even when they&#8217;re offline, but with great power come great gotchas. For instance, files always come from the ApplicationCache, even when the user is online. Oh, and in certain circumstances, a browser won&#8217;t know that that the online content has changed &mdash; causing the user to keep getting old content. And, oh yes, depending on how you cache your resources, non-cached resources may not load even when the user is online.
