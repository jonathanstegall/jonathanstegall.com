I know I haven’t blogged about it yet, and I hope to do so soon, but I’m going to be a dad. So I’ve been reading some new voices, and this is one of them. “I mean, we were the boys who played so well — who built forts, who created different worlds in our bedrooms, who made cars screech and skid and launch on the folds of our bedsheets. We’ve got that in us — we’re like the artisans of playtime.”
