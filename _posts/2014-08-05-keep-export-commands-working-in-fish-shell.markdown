I enjoy the Fish command line shell on OSX, but occasionally it causes issues with items in my `.bash_profile` since it doesn't like export commands. I kept reading about how Fish expects other types of commands, but I really didn't have time to go through all the things I had and translate them. But finally I didn't want to lose Fish, so I found this: a translator for export, into Fish.
