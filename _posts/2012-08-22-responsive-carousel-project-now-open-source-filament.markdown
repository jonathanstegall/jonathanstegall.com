> In our responsive client work, we frequently find ourselves in need of a carousel component that is lightweight, fluid in layout, usable with different input modes (mouse, keyboard, touch), and extensible to the particulars of each implementation. Weâ€™ve found that most third-party carousels available online fall short of these requirements in one way or another, so we built our own, and recently made it public for others to use as well.
