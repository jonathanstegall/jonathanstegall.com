From <a href="http://www.johnsmulo.com/Blogging/blog-comment-day-2008.html">John Smulo</a>:
<blockquote><p>Though there may be 100 reasons why people blog, I've yet to meet a blogger who doesn't appreciate comments. For this reason I'm starting Blog Comment Day on December 3, 2008. Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>On December 3, 2008 you will leave one comment on at least 5 different blogs.</li>
<li>Out of the 5 blogs you comment on, at least 2 of them will be blogs you haven't commented on previously.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
Right. This Wednesday, I'd love to encourage you to take part in Blog Comment Day 2008. If you plan to participate, do visit the link above and leave a comment. Great way to prepare yourself.

Anyway. Certainly there are blogs that do not allow comments, and blogs who's authors do not dialogue with the comments for various reasons, but of the blogs that have authors who do engage with those leaving comments, it's fairly safe to say that it is a privilege for the author to have that kind of connection with readers.

I don't get a particularly large number of comments, but it's great to get the ones that I do, and respond with other comments, or with emails, depending on the situation. So, if you need a blog to comment on, why not this one?
