First part of a series that investigates solidarity and resistance in community. This part examines our tendency to congratulate ourselves for very small things - moving into poor neighborhoods, living in community, serving a few of the poor, helping a few folks change their lives, etc. - in light of the fact that larger structural changes go unachieved. Powerful things for us to think about.
