Some amazing examples of the future of HTML5, especially smart forms. The forms can best be viewed in Opera, though there are some that work nicely in Safari too. I can’t imagine how wonderful it will be to stop worrying about JavaScript for this kind of stuff. I wonder if will negate some serverside validation as well?
