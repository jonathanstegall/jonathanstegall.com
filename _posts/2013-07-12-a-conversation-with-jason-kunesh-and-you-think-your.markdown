An interview between Tracey Varnell of Adaptive Path and Jason Kunesh, Director of User Experience of Obama for America - the first UX person to be in a presidential campaign.





They talk about how the campaign did UX work, how they dealt with internal politics, and how UX can shape politics in general, among other things.
