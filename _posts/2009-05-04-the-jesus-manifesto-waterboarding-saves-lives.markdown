> We should condemn torture not because torture is an exceptional form of violence but because it so utterly exemplifies the violence that characterizes fallen humanity. We bear witness to a new way of life in which we have no need of torture because we have no need of violence at all, and we bear testimony to a day when this will be the norm for all of creation.
