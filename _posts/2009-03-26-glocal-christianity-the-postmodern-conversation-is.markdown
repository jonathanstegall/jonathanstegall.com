Looks at the idea that the postmodern conversation is over. We discussed this possibility when I was in college in 2004, and we concluded that in many ways it is indeed over. Whether we use the term or not, the pieces of this shift are making their way into the collective consciousness, which is part of the reason for less activity around the word itself. In addition to this, whether we use the term or not, many people are still ignorant of the shiftâ€™s existence, which is another part of the reason. The edge is always moving.
