Don Norman is always a fantastic one to read, but this one is his embrace, and his explanation of what he’s embracing, of the label “design thinking.” I love the way he recognizes that all innovators practice it, but that it is the hallmark of modern design. There’s no limit to who can use it, and that's important.
