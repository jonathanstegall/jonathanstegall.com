I talk a lot about my overlapping interests in both design and theology. Over the years it's become one of the things I think about most.

In the last couple of years, I've been much more distant from the theology world than I used to, for many reasons. The faith communities we used to be so closely integrated with have fallen apart. My wife graduated from seminary. We had a daughter. So I've got less time and less opportunity than I used to for reading and talking about theology, and much of what remains ends up funnelled through Twitter.

So while it certainly isn't out of my life, there's a distance between me and theology that is new in the last 15 years or so.

Recently it became clear to me that the more that distance grows, the more I look at design and say "theology has something to say to that." I used to look at theology and think "design has something to say to that." While I still do both of those things, the frequency, apparently, tends to be related to distance.
