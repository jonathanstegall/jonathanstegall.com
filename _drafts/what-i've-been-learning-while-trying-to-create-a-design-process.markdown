I've been working at Emory University, on an internal agency-like team that has ranged in size from four people to six, for just over two years now. I blog much less than I used to, though, so I haven't really taken the time to share what I've been learning and doing while I've been there. I've been thinking it's time to start doing that.

So, a start. It's been just over a year since my team started regularly talking to actual users of the sites we work on, and/or watching them use sites (whether ours, or pre-existing). It has been an unevenly distributed thing in that some projects involve a great deal of this and at good intervals with good results, while others involve a bit at the wrong time without very many results, while still others involve none at all for various reasons of money and culture, and everything in between has also occurred. I figure this is normal for a brand new user experience process. The way I talk to myself about it is this: we didn't talk to users before, and now we do. It's nothing to write home about, per se, but it is almost something out of nothing and that is something to celebrate.

## What has gone well

I've been a part of some projects where I've been able to frame the case for talking to users, and things come together in a way that customers understand what we're trying to learn and why it is valuable. They want to learn everything about their users and are willing to get us access to them. It's a brilliant thing to see.

When this happens, the process tends to go like this:

1. Figure out actual, measurable business goals.
2. Determine what we don't currently know that would help us achieve those goals. Make some research goals, and research questions to which we need answers.
3. Define some exercises that would let us answer our research questions, and achieve our research goals.
4. Plan and conduct those exercises.
5. Look at the results, and see what we need to create.
