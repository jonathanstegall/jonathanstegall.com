For those in the Atlanta area who are interested in such things, there is a lot of great stuff happening in the next week or so. I want to present some of it, and encourage you to get involved if you are able. I'll hope to post some things about these happenings after they occur, as well.

For one thing, <a href="http://www.followingthetracks.blogspot.com/">Tim and Jenn Fidanzo</a> are coming. I just recently learned of their travels around the country in an RV powered by vegetable oil, in order to give away their possessions and share love with the poor and marginalized. It's a beautiful thing, and they will be spending some time in Atlanta next week.

Obviously, they'll be looking for places to put their RV, and I'm sure will also be open to good meals and such.

For another thing, <a href="http://www.peterrollins.net/">Peter Rollins</a> is coming to Atlanta on his current U.S. tour. Peter is an author, theologian, philosopher, and a leader of the <a href="http://www.ikon.org.uk">Ikon</a> community in Belfast. He has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557255059?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jonathanstega-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1557255059">How (Not) to Speak of God</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557255601?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jonathanstega-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1557255601">The Fidelity of Betrayal: Towards a Church Beyond Belief</a>, and has an <a href="http://peterrollins.net/blog/">amazing blog</a>.

While he is in Atlanta, we will have several events with him:
<ul class="event-list">

		<h3><a href="http://www.livingroomchurch.org/2008/11/tnevda-reversal-of-traditional-25-day.html">tnevdA: a reversal of the traditional 25 day countdown to Christmas</a></h3>
		<h4>November 24th at <a href="http://www.livingroomchurch.org/">The Living Room</a> - 7pm</h4>
	  <blockquote><p>Think of the greatest possible holiday moment, the Christmas of your dreams.  Now walk back a day into the lack of that moment. Take another step back into postponed pleasure, into that place of wishing, hoping, longing. Take step after step... day after day.... backward. Back into loss, into hopelessness, into the empty.</p></blockquote>
