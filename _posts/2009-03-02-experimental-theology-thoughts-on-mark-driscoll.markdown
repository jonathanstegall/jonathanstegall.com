Great thoughts on what Mark Driscoll is really doing when he talks about masculinity in the church. “The point of this post is that when Driscoll starts talking about gender and people start pushing back there is a lot of stuff that starts flying around: Agenic motives, gender role interests, educational fissures, power and misogyny. It all blends together in a conversational stew ostensibly about “real guys.” And if we are not clear about what we are talking about we talk past each other.”
