Larry reflects on the wakefulness and watchfulness that, while associated with Advent, can lead us to either a dispensationalism that doesn’t need the incarnation, or a frenetic activism that doesn’t need God, and posits that both of these are wrong in light of possibilities available to us. Beautiful reflections.
