> And yet, I believe that if there is judgment coming (or being made manifest) from God due to abortion, it rests heaviest on the shoulders of those of us who are pro-life. We are the ones who have failed. We have been disobedient and our whole country is reaping the consequences.

I should probably state up front that this one isn't about how prolifers failed to outlaw abortion, but is more nuanced and Jesus-focused than that. Worthy of context.
