> So I’ve composed this reading list for experience, design, and strategy based on what’s most readable and reference-able. Many of these are short, fast, and compelling reads that are more fun and fascinating than burdensome to plod through. My hope is that these are the right speed and shape so that you’ll get them into your brain.
