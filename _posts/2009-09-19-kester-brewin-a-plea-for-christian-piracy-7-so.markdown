Part seven of a series examining our fascination with pirates, and what it means for our faith. This one looks at why children love pirates so much, and what children and parents are both offered by the challenge of pirates. I didn’t link to the series as it was being written, like I should have, so it’s all here at once - on Talk Like A Pirate Day!
