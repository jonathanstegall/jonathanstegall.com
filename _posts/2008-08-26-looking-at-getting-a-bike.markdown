So, as a life-related aside, I'm looking into purchasing a bike. One of the nice benefits <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/">where I work</a> is an annual wellness benefit, where we receive an amount of money that we can use on... wellness. Workout equipment, bikes, gym memberships, weight loss, things to help quit smoking, and so on. It's a wonderful thing.

In any case, this year I want to use it toward getting a bike. <a href="http://kierastegall.com/">My wife</a> and I live in a small one bedroom apartment in Atlanta, and don't really have a place to put a large object like a bike, or the desire to get mud and all those things all over carpet that we don't own. So, I'm very interested in getting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_bicycle">folding bicycle</a> that I can leave in my car, or leave in a corner of the apartment where it doesn't take up much space.

Our working arrangements are not such that we could get rid of a car in favor of a bike, unfortunately, but I do hope and plan for this to be the case in the near future.

With all that said, I'd love to hear any recommendations for good folding bikes. Reasonably priced, long lasting, folding bikes. In the beginning parts of my search, I have been impressed by the <a href="http://www.shopatron.com/product/part_number=DA612/412.0">Dahon Espresso</a> and the <a href="http://www.shopatron.com/product/part_number=KC072/412.0">Dahon Speed</a>. Similar recommendations, or contrary recommendations, are welcome.
