<blockquote>
  <p>But then a doom-obsessed dispensationalist performs an eschatological sleight of hand and takes the hope away from us. On one hand they admit that Jesus is the Prince of Peace who has come, but on the other hand they say his peace is not for now&hellip;it&rsquo;s only for when Jesus comes back again. Bait and switch. Yes, swords are to become plowshares&hellip;but not today. For now plowshares become swords; but in our day, it&rsquo;s war, war, war! They abuse Jesus&rsquo; prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem in the first century by always applying it to the latest contemporary geopolitical events. They replace the hope of peace with an anticipation of war! They find a way to make war a hopeful sign.</p>
