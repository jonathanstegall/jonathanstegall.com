If you are a member of Facebook, or if you aren't, please consider the following:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.notforsalecampaign.org/">Not For Sale</a> (NFS) is a campaign of individuals, musicians, artists, people of faith, businesses, schools and sports teams united to stop human trafficking and end modern day slavery in our lifetime.</blockquote>
On Facebook, there is currently an award of $50,000 US being offered to the organization (through Causes) that gets the most unique donors in seven days. The seven days ends at Noon PST (3pm EST) February 1st. The amount of the donation is not the issue; the number of donors is. Not For Sale is requesting $10 donations, as that is the minimum qualifying amount.

For more information, see the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/view_cause/56110?recruiter_id=3362455">Not For Sale Giving Challenge 2008</a> cause on Facebook. This alone is worth giving in and getting a Facebook account, if you don't have one already.

There are over 27 million people around the world who exist in slavery. Today. Not 1864. Today. It is more of an issue than it has ever been in recorded history. It's wonderful to see action being taken, and ways in which we can be involved in that action.
