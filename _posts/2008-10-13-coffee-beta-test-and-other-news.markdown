I've been quiet recently, I know. I haven't finished my series. Yes, it will be finished. I've been trying to devote a lot of time to finishing a fairly large design project, as there are many other things I'd like to be spending time on. Including this website. Still. Maybe it will happen before this year is over.

Anyway. There are a couple of things that are worthy of mention during the downtime.

One is <a href="http://www.joffreys.com/">Joffrey's Coffee</a>. I've been honored by the opportunity to test a couple of their coffee blends recently, including the <a href="http://www.joffreys.com/_product_29700/Coffee_2-0">Coffee 2.0</a>, which was put together by using the feedback of bloggers. It is amazing: both as a coffee and as a business model. In addition to this, Joffrey's is built on the benefits of fair trade and other sustainable business practices.

On a different note, a recent documentary called <a href="http://www.callandresponsemovie.com/">Call + Response</a> is out in theaters in several major cities, including Atlanta. Call + Response is the first feature-length documentary designed to expose and raise funds to stop the modern slave trade, which involves over 27 million slaves and, in 2007, brought in more money than Google, Nike, and Starbucks combined. It is attempting to bring together artists, musicians, and others to <a href="http://www.betheresponse.com/">try to make a difference</a>.

Atlanta is uniquely in need of this awareness and this kind of activism, as it is the number one city in the United States for sex trafficking. Visit <a href="http://www.innocenceatlanta.org/">Innocence Atlanta</a> for more information on this.

I say all that to say this: if you are in a city that is hosting this movie, go see it. If you are not, <a href="mailto:bringit@callandresponse.com?subject=Bring-This-To-My-City">ask them</a> to bring it.
