Currently, I'm in the midst of a hunt for a Content Management System (CMS) to use for a client project. Basically, this hunt is occurring in the hopes that I can save time on the project by using something that is already in existence. The system I'm looking for would have to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Create a directory of businesses, with support for international locations and a hook for and/or built in support for the Google Maps API.</li>
<li>Allow for different levels of businesses, and also a hook for and/or built in support for ecommerce to create said levels.</li>
<li>Allow for these businesses to be filed in categories based on the field of business where they practice.</li>
<li>Allow for these businesses to be connected with the kinds of things they do. For example, an auto mechanic might be connected with replacing radiators. These things would have to be connected with the field of business. For example, a lawyer would probably not replace radiators.</li>
<li>Allow these businesses to be searched by location, category, and things performed by the business</li>
<li>Be secure, including form validation, user access, and blocking of at least the most common vulnerabilities (if I know about it, it should definitely be blocked)
<ul>
<li>I was researching Joomla in the hopes that it might provide such a solution, when the site I was looking at was hacked and taken down as I navigated it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
I feel like such a search may be a pipe dream, and that if I did find such a solution, it would probably have such a high learning curve that I wouldn't save time over a custom built solution, which is the goal of this search in the first place. However, the search makes me wish I had already had the time to learn Ruby/Rails and Python/Django...
