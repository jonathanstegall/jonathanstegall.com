> In Windows 7, websites could be ‘pinned’ to the taskbar (which used a 32px resource in the favicon.ico file) but now they can also be pinned to to the start screen, having a special Windows 8 ‘tile’ of their own.
> 
> If you don’t provide your own tile image, the OS will simply use a light grey version of the IE logo.
