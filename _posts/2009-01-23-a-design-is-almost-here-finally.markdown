If you have followed this blog for any length of time, you would be forgiven for thinking that it will never get the custom theme that I mention from time to time.

Being a designer who has opinions on a number of things, and one who likes to take side projects from time to time, makes it difficult for this kind of site to get a design. But - it is almost here!

There is actually a design that I think I'm happy with, and will hopefully be implementing as a custom theme over the next week or so.
