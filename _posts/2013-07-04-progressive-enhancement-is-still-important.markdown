> Given the diversity of user agents, your JS failing isn't an edge case. Sometimes it'll be the browser's fault, sometimes yours. For example, a few months ago the JavaScript on the Download Chrome page failed. Y'know what happened when you clicked the "Download Chrome" button? Nothing. A dash of progressive enhancement would have allowed people to continue downloading Chrome while the problem was fixed.
