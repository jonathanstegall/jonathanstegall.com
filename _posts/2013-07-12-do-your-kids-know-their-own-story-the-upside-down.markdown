> And really, that’s why I tell my kids these stories about themselves. I want them to know that they have a purpose for being here. I want them to understand how important they – and all people – are just through their existence. And researchers know that people who see their lives as an unfolding story rather than a conglomeration of events and periods in one’s life are happier and more fulfilled. I want my kids to know how to create their own stories and claim their credit in the world. I always think these stories we tell our kids about themselves are like a little building block we can give them to get them started.
