> What Christ demands first is love of God and neighbor which means forgiveness and charity to those with whom we associate at any level. The very system of the US economy must run counter to this understanding of the world. Devotion to God is devotion to something very different than system that relies on debt to survive and grow. It relies on a love that forgives debts as an act of devotion not to profit, but to God.
