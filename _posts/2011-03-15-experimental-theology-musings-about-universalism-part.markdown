Richard Beck continues his brilliant series on universalism. This one explains why he thinks universalism (in the Christian sense) is the more biblical view, even while granting that all such things are speculation. You really should have a look at his series, whatever your eschatology is. I don’t necessarily agree with his series, but it’s deeply worthy of consideration.
