excerpt: I've recently found a site called <a href=\"http://christiansconfess.com/\">Christians Confess</a>. I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful things I've seen on the Internet. While the idea of Christians confessing for the wrongs we've committed, especially toward non-Christians, is <a href=\"http://www.donaldmillerwords.com/\">not</a> <a href=\"http://www.revolutionatlanta.com/\">new</a>, I love seeing it.

I've recently found a site called <a href="http://christiansconfess.com/">Christians Confess</a>. I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful things I've seen on the Internet.

Seeing it online, where hopefully many people will see it, is a wonderful thing. It's been written about in amazing ways. We at <a href="http://www.revolutionchurch.com/">Revolution</a> put it on stickers, it's been spoken of so many times, and the more we speak of it the better chance we actually have of people believing us. We must be sorry, and we must express it. I must be sorry.
