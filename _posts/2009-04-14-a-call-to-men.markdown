> So today I want to call men out of their own oppression by refusing to oppress the other half of themselves: women.  And Iâ€™m talking flat out refuse.  This is not a call to think about it.  This is a call to step up and own it as a completely different way of living, one defined by grace, invitation, and permission, not shame, rejection, and fear.
