> We can only effectively preach God’s wisdom to the Powers if we are, at the same time, moving into a life freed from slavery to the Powers. We can only challenge Mammon if it isn’t our god. We can only reject nationalism if we live recognising there is no hierarchy amongst peoples. We will only resist social injustice if justice is expressed in our common life.
