I have an amazing wife who walks through life with me. Plus, she's hot. We were twenty year old college students, and I wouldn't change a thing about our lives together.

She's an amazing woman with a wonderful heart that sees the best and the worst of mine. I have learned so much from her, and continue to learn everyday.

Below are lyrics to our wedding song that I play on the morning of each anniversary. <a href="http://www.tourniquet.net/">Tourniquet</a>'s <em>When the Love is Right</em>. Kiera, I love you. Thank you for always being with me.
<blockquote>
The journey through our life can bring
A place and time for everything
A day of hope, a year of fears
A thousand smiles, a million tears

Our paths were meant to cross
And I couldn't forget you
No matter what the cost
We both had to see this through

Take my hand, take my heart
We will never be apart
Never be apart
Because I love you

Follow me and I'll lead you
Lead me and I'll follow you
Anywhere, anytime
When the love is right
The path is bright

From the Father of lights you came
And I know I'll never be the same again
A beautiful gift has been given to me
Your smiling face is all I see

The look that's in your eyes
And your smile that sets me free
Has made me realize
All that you see in me

Take my hand, take my heart
We will never be apart
Never be apart
Because I love you

Follow me and I'll lead you
Lead me and I'll follow you
Anywhere, anytime
When the love is right
The path is bright

Together now and forever
You are the one
You are my everything
To me you bring
The love that I have waited for

The look that's in your eyes
And your smile that sets me free
Has made me realize
All that you see in me
Our paths were meant to cross
And I couldn't forget you
The soul in you is the soul in me
The way that it was meant to be
