I’m not all that involved in the recent discussions of whether the emerging church is too white (both because it isn’t, unless you mean Emergent Village, and because I want to listen more than I talk, being a white guy), though I have watched the conversations and found many viewpoints that I agree with and many that I really disagree with. This is a great one. “If it does not have a cross section which looks exactly like an approximation of the make-up of the world or at least America, it is too  something. ALWAYS.”
