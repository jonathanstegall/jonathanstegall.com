I have to admit: when it comes to chocolate, I can take it or leave it. But when it comes to the ethics of chocolate, I care greatly about the horrible slave-driven industry that produces most of the world’s chocolate, and take every opportunity I can to celebrate ethically made chocolate like this brand’s. They also seem to place a lot of value on high quality design, judging from their website.
