Matthew Paul Turner has a guest post on things men need to know about sex with their wives. And seriously: most men don’t know about these things, or they don’t care. It is LIBERATING to have equality between the sexes, and this DOES include sex as much as it does anything else. Sex is too often the last thing a feminist realizes that she deserves to enjoy just as much as a man, and thus the stereotypes continue.
