And this is the aforementioned part 2. It’s important to see this, in light of all the recent criticisms of Jim Wallis and Sojourners. My own view is that if progressive types can’t accept someone who may or may not disagree with them on one issue (but has thus far not taken a position), but has definitely dropped the ball on a justice issue for whatever reason, they are acting as badly as conservatives who do the same thing and are rightly criticized for it.
