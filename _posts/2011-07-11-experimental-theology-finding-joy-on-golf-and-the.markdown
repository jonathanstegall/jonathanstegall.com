> So we are walking a fine line here. On the one hand, you donâ€™t want to say that the Sermon is unattainable because clearly it is attainable. We really should try to attain to the ideals set out in the Sermon. And, with the help of God, we actually can attain these things. But on the other hand, the Sermon is so imposing we know we are surely going to fail. A lot. So how are we to thread the needle?
