> Put plainly, sourcemaps are a way to map compiled code back to its native state. That may sound kind of odd, but sourcemaps will make every Sass-loving developerâ€™s life a little bit better. Browsers that understand the generated map file will know where each and every line of code came from, down to the line number in the original Sass file, rather than the line number from the compiled CSS file.
