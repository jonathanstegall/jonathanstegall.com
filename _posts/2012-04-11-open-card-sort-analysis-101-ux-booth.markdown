> One of the biggest problems facing information architects (IAs) today is crafting the perfect content hierarchy, one that quickly gets users to the information they&rsquo;re looking for. To do this, information architects need to first query their users. How do the people browsing and/or searching this site think about its content? In search of an answer, IAs often employ card sorts; however, they inevitably produce a great deal of data. Knowing how to correctly structure and analyze that data can help architects attain the perfection they seek.
