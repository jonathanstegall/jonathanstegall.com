> By breaking the site up into patterns, it&rsquo;s easier to find those bits of markup. I noticed an issue on GitHub about there being no styles for dl, dd, and dt elements, and it took a while to find an example of them being used on the site. With a pattern library, all the elements that appear on the site are in one place so you don&rsquo;t have to go searching round for them.
