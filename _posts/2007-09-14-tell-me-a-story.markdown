excerpt: "I'm planning to begin a series of posts. I've never done a long series of posts (longer than two or three), but I think this one might be a wise thing to do. I've written and talked often on the idea that there is often a higher way of looking at things than the typical conservative vs liberal divide, or the typical whatever vs whatever divide. We see this in the writings of N.T. Wright, we see it in writings of Brian McLaren, and many others; but why not discuss some stories?"

I'm planning to begin a series of posts. I've never done a long series of posts (longer than two or three), but I think this one might be a wise thing to do. I've written and talked often on the idea that there is often a higher way of looking at things than the typical conservative vs liberal divide, or the typical whatever vs whatever divide. We see this in the writings of N.T. Wright, we see it in writings of Brian McLaren, and many others; but why not discuss some stories? I'll present views from many different sources, I'm sure.
<h3>What stories to tell?</h3>
I have several stories in mind, and would like to really delve into this idea over the next few months. Some of them are these:
<ul>
	<li>Creation</li>
	<li>the Exodus</li>
	<li>formation of the Pentateuch (first 5 books of the Old Testament)</li>
	<li>Job</li>
	<li>Wisdom Literature (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes)</li>
	<li>Jonah</li>
	<li>the Virgin Birth idea</li>
	<li>Weird things Paul wrote</li>
	<li>Revelation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Send me stories</h3>
I'm very open to other ideas, but these are things that I've had conversations about, thoughts about, and questions about. If you have other ideas, please, post a comment. It may be a few weeks before this little series begins. Ideally, I'd like to be able to release posts on it at intervals; maybe once a week, or once every two weeks (thankfully, WordPress allows bloggers to schedule posts).
