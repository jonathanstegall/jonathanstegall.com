> When adding UI animations to your own work, prototyping and iteration are your secret weapons. Practice makes perfect, of course, but more importantly it really is impossible to know whether an animation fits in context without trying it out. The faster the prototyping method, the better. Knock out a quick and dirty example using whatever you&rsquo;re most comfortable with&mdash;CSS, After Effects, Edge Animate, or another tool. Production-ready code, or even any code at all, isn&rsquo;t important here.
