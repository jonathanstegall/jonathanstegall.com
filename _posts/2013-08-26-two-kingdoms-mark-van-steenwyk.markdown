> A long while back, someone asked me to clarify my views on the relationship between the Church and the State. You see, there are all kinds of ways of looking at how they relate. And this is only complicated by the fact that what folks mean by “church” or “state” is never nail-down-able. There are different understandings of each and different expressions of each. Nevertheless, I want to try to get at this question by starting with my own story. My goal here is to briefly lay out my own take on what Christians should do with government (and other systems that exert power over us).
