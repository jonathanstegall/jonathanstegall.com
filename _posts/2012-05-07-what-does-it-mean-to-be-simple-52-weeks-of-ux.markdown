> So a better definition of simple is &#8216;just enough for comprehension and the ability to pursue and complete our goals.&#8217; Instead of hiding or cutting stuff away, here is how we can achieve more meaningful simplicity in our designs:
> 
> - Have a single core idea (not several ideas, or a partial idea)
> - Improve clarity over time (don&rsquo;t overwhelm with inappropriate details)
> - Use consistency (avoid using unnecessarily unique interfaces and messages)
