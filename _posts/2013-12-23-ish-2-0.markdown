> I’m happy to introduce ish. 2.0. For the uninitiated, ish. is yet another viewport resizing tool. It’s called “ish.” because it focuses on general ranges (small-ish. medium-ish. large-ish.), rather than popular device widths. It’s our jobs as web designers to make sure our interfaces look and function across all screen sizes, and ish. is here to help.
