> Video for Everybody is very simply a chunk of HTML code that embeds a video into a website using the HTML5  element which offers native playback in Firefox 3.5, Safari 3 &amp; 4, Google Chrome and an increasing number of other browsers.” It falls back to QuickTime, then to Flash, if necessary. Beautiful.
