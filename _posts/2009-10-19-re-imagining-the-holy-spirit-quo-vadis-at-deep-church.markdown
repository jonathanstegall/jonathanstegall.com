Here are some thoughts on the experience of the Spirit within the emerging church. I have begun to think, in recent months, that this may be one of the things I can, or at least want to try, to contribute to Emergent. I think there is much room for emerging/charismatic/Pentecostal hyphenateds, as Phyllis would say, and I want to see more than the little bit weâ€™ve already seen. But I also think that there is deep, deep possibility for charismatic experience within Emergent specifically.
