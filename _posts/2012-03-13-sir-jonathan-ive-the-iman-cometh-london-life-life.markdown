From Jonny Ive:

> A: We struggle with the right words to describe the design process at  Apple, but it is very much about designing and prototyping and making. When you separate those, I think the final result suffers. If something is going to be better, it is new, and if it&rsquo;s new you are confronting problems and challenges you don&rsquo;t have references for. To solve and address those requires a remarkable focus. There&rsquo;s a sense of being inquisitive and optimistic, and you don&rsquo;t see those in combination very often.
