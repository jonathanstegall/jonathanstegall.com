> I decided to undertake a different approach to kickoff meetings, applying design thinking, constraints, and interactive exercises to develop a kickoff framework that was more similar to a playbook of activities I could pull from to begin to define and begin to solve problems for clients. I am in the business of creating experiences for the web, and although these exercises are designed to support that type of process, you might find them useful in putting together kickoffs for other kinds of projects as well.
