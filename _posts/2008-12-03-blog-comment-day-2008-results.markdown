<a href="http://johnsmulo.com/Blogging/blog-comment-day-comments-gone-wild.html">Blog Comment Day 2008</a> is, of course, upon us. I commented on a few blogs, some that I had never seen before and some that I read regularly but have never commented on, and one where I comment fairly often.

As some others are doing, here are some posts, thus far. Feel free to join the conversations.
