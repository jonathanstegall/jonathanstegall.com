> So, dear friends, at Capitol Hill and in the White House and on Wall Street. To media moguls at The New York Times, CNN, and even The Daily Show: Be patient. It isnâ€™t the right time yet for demands.  This is a new paradigm, a new road we are walking. This occupation may look like those of yesteryear, but it is not. This is a revolution that is shaping not just policy and what we do, but process and how we do it. This is the moment that social justice organizations and community groups that have labored late into the evening trying to reach consensus have waited for. This is the moment that awkward and difficult anti-oppression trainings and nonviolence teach-ins have prepared for.
