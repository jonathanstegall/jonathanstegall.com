Great post that calls us to practice Angst-giving and reject the myths that Empire gives us.

> And so, this Thanksgiving, I encourage you to practice Angst-giving. Not as an expression of ungratitude. Rather, give thanks to God for those things that are blessings. And repent and lament those things that flow from injustice.
