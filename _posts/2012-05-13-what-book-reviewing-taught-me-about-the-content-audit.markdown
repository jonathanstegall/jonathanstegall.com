> Another way to look at book reviewing is that a book reviewer is a content auditor. The book reviewer&rsquo;s job is not simply to offer a thumbs up or a thumbs down, but to examine the book&rsquo;s qualities and draw out evidence that communicates why it is or isn&rsquo;t worth reading, what it does or doesn&rsquo;t offer, whether the content does or does not deliver on what the title and back cover copy promises.
