title: Send a tent to Haiti
excerpt: "As you may know, Haiti has a rainy season that is in its beginning stages.
  You may also know that an unbearable number of Haitians are homeless. Many have
  been given nothing but tarps to shelter through the rain. Too many NGOs and government
  organizations discouraged the sending of tents to the country (due to space, apparently),
  and further too many of these large organizations bought out the stock of tents
  for themselves. Finally, though, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8522732.stm\">UN
  pleaded for tents</a> as a desperate need.\r\n\r\nSince the earthquake, an acquaintance
  of ours, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/shaunking\">Shaun King</a>, has been working
  tirelessly here in Atlanta and with folks on the ground in Haiti to bring awareness
  to these things, <a href=\"http://www.ahomeinhaiti.org/\">calling for and providing
  tents</a> from the beginning. The need, though, continues to be dire. Please <a
  href=\"http://www.ahomeinhaiti.org/\">send a tent</a> if you can."

As you may know, Haiti has a rainy season that is in its beginning stages. You may also know that an unbearable number of Haitians are homeless. Many have been given nothing but tarps to shelter through the rain. Too many NGOs and government organizations discouraged the sending of tents to the country (due to space, apparently), and further too many of these large organizations bought out the stock of tents for themselves. Finally, though, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8522732.stm">UN pleaded for tents</a> as a desperate need.

Since the earthquake, an acquaintance of ours, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shaunking">Shaun King</a>, has been working tirelessly here in Atlanta and with folks on the ground in Haiti to bring awareness to these things, <a href="http://www.ahomeinhaiti.org/">calling for and providing tents</a> from the beginning. The need, though, continues to be dire. Please <a href="http://www.ahomeinhaiti.org/">send a tent</a> if you can.

Shaun has shared seminary classes with Kiera at <a href="http://candler.emory.edu/">Candler</a>. He also <a href="http://shauninthecity.com/">blogs</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shaunking">tweets prolifically</a>, and pastors <a href="http://courageous.tv/">a church</a> here in Atlanta. We don't agree with him on everything, but he is real and crazy, and is <em>getting things done</em>. You can trust him. You can purchase a tent and send it directly to his church, or you can donate money and they will purchase it. Either way it will then be sent directly to teams on the ground in Haiti.

He'll be <a href="http://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/9352376106">taking trips</a> to Haiti in March, but as I said he has been working with small, effective groups on the ground in Haiti since the earthquake. He has been able to avoid the utter gridlock that often happens when bigger organizations like the Red Cross were not previously in the country, and their aid gets stopped at the Haitian government (this is the benefit of both long-term organizations like <a href="http://www.worldconcern.org/">World Concern</a>, and of small groups of untrained, passionate individuals who work with those organizations).
