On the enneagram, Iâ€™m an investigator. This describes me really well, I think, as does the INTJ on the MBTI, and there is fascinating information on these pages. I do share the reservations that some have about the possibility of pigeonholing people with this kind of data, but I think we can guard against this and learn much.
