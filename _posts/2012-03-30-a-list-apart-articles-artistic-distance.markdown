This reminds me of one of the best things about art school: objective critiques of each other&rsquo;s work. I haven&rsquo;t really had that in some time.

Further, it gives specific ways to create &ldquo;artistic distance&rdquo; between oneself and the work, regardless of whether other folks are involved. Necessary.
