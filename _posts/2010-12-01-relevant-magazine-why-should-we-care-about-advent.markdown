Rob Bell reflects on why we should care about Advent, and the church calendar as a whole. I’ve rarely cared about the church calendar, though I’m beginning to think that it’s an important opportunity for us to get out of the realm of civil religion. “What the church calendar does is create space for Jesus to meet us in the full range of human experience, for God to speak to us across the spectrum, in the good and the bad, in the joy and in the tears.”
