When I was posting about my Mac envy, I mentioned my hard drive crashing, and my fear that I was to lose all of my data and <del datetime="2007-03-02T12:58:43+00:00">get to</del> be forced to switch to Apple sooner than I had prepared to do so. I forgot to mention the solution to the data issue that <del datetime="2007-03-02T12:58:43+00:00">stopped me from getting a Mac</del> let me get all my important data back.

There's a program called <a href="http://www.runtime.org/gdb.htm">Get Data Back</a>. Evidently, it is used by approximately 70% of Fortune 500 companies, and as I've searched the net I haven't seen anything negative about it. In any case, the basic workflow of this program is this:
<ol>
	<li>you have a hard drive crash, power failure, virus, etc.</li>
	<li>life as you know it is over</li>
	<li>you visit <a href="http://www.runtime.org/gdb.htm">Get Data Back</a>, and download the free trial</li>
	<li>said free trial, if installed on a <strong>working</strong> Windows drive, allows you to see the directory structures, and open the files, on the corrupt drive... but you cannot save them</li>
	<li>you think... I'm saved. I can get my data back. You pay the money for your hard drive's correct version of the program (NTFS was $79).</li>
	<li>You run the paid version, and get your data back. You gush and ooo and aaaaa and tell everyone about <a href="http://www.runtime.org/gdb.htm">Get Data Back</a></li>
</ol>

So I'm a big fan. And, of course, if I should encounter another hard drive crash, I still have my license. Out of 50 gigs of used hard drive space, I was able to retrieve everything I could possibly have needed. And, of course, a bunch of random stuff I don't need.
