So. <a href="http://www.crucialencounter.com/">Andy</a> is one of my best friends. He just got married yesterday, and I wanted to say major congratulations to him and <a href="http://www.shalomexistence.com/">Andrea</a>.

The new bride and groom are both authentic people, and at the same time they are authentically in love with each other and their God. For me, this is a great compliment, and it is one that I bestow rarely. Many couples have none of those qualities, and many only have one or two.

<a href="http://kierastegall.com/">Kiera</a> and I have been able to watch their relationship for a couple of years, and have been honored to be able to offer occasional encouragement and advice. We've learned a lot about marriage, about ourselves and each other and our God, in the last few years, and find it to be a blessing to share our various experiences, and what we've learned through them, with other couples.

But for now, we hope they enjoy our gift.
