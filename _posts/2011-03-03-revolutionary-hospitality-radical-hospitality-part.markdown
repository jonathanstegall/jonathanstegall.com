> The ultimate goal of hospitality (best typified by the early Christian practice of table fellowship) is tearing down the walls of division. And that, I believe, includes economic walls. We must, as folks who depend upon the mercy of God, realize that those of us who have houses don’t “deserve” to be sheltered any more than those who don’t have homes. That the divisions between homeless and housed, rich and poor, powerful and meek, do not reflect the Kingdom of God.
