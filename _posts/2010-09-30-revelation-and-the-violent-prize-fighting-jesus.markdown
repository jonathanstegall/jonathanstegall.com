Greg Boyd takes on the literal interpretations of the imagery of Revelation that have done so much damage, both to understanding of the nonviolent message of Jesus and to a wise way of seeing the Bible as consisting of different types of literature. Being unable to see this and take it seriously is a deep problem, and this kind of post shows a way past that.
