  <p>I&rsquo;m happy to introduce ish. 2.0. For the uninitiated, ish. is yet another viewport resizing tool. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;ish.&rdquo; because it focuses on general ranges (small-ish. medium-ish. large-ish.), rather than popular device widths. It&rsquo;s our jobs as web designers to make sure our interfaces look and function across all screen sizes, and ish. is here to help.</p>
