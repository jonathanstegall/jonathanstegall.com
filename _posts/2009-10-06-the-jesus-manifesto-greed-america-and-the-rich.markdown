This reverberates through questions and arguments I’ve had inside myself with relation to wealth, especially recently. Convicting and powerful. “When wealthy people come to faith, they are to share everything with the poor, who receive it. But the poor and the wealthy don’t then go their separate ways, rather, they live as family. The goal of downward mobility isn’t mere charity, but solidarity.”
