Out in Portland, there is a church called <a href="http://www.imagodeicommunity.com/">Imago Dei Community</a>.

Anyway. Rick McKinley has written a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F1590525019%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dcenter-2%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0Q39Y87SX6KEHQGDPCBR%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D101%26pf%5Frd%5Fp%3D278240301%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D507846&amp;tag=jonathanstega-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJesus-Margins-Finding-Places-Ignore%2Fdp%2F1590523873&amp;tag=jonathanstega-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">books</a>. Evidently, he has some copies of <em>This Beautiful Mess</em> around, and has offered to give a copy to people who will write a review about it on their blogs, or wherever. Today, I got my copy. Not only is it amazing that an author would do that, it looks like it will be an amazing book.

I've never done it this way before, but my plan is to blog about each chapter as I read it. Another series! Woo ho!
