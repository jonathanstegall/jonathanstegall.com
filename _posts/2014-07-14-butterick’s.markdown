	<p>This book is based on three principles.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Good ty­pog­ra­phy is part of good writing.</li>
	<li>As a pro­fes­sion­al writer, you should hold your doc­u­ments to the same stan­dards as pro­fes­sion­al­ly pub­lished ma­te­r­i­al. Why? Be­cause your doc­u­ments <em>are</em> pro­fes­sion­al­ly pub­lished material. <p>More­over, much of what writ­ers con­sid­er prop­er ty­pog­ra­phy is an ac­cu­mu­la­tion of bad habits and ur­ban leg­ends. These will be set aside in fa­vor of pro­fes­sion­al ty­po­graph­ic habits.</p></li>
	<li>Any writer can mas­ter the es­sen­tials of good typography.</li>
	</ol>
