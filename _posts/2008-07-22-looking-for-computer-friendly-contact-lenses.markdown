As a bit of an aside from various posts I have in the works, I have an appointment with an optometrist this weekend. The last time I went to one was just shortly after I began working fulltime in front of a computer screen, around the summer of 2006, and the contacts that I wore at the time caused my eyes lots of trouble.

By trouble, I mean that my eyes would get red a lot, the lenses would move around more than they should, my eyes would produce lots of 'sleep' (I'm not sure what the technical term for that gooey stuff is), and so on. My boss at the time always thought I had pink eye and would spray my keyboard with anti-bacterial sprays, so I gave up and got a pair of glasses that I've been wearing since then.

For a little bit more context, I began wearing contacts when I was eleven years old, and wore them until I was 23, so I do have a good bit of experience with the ways that they should work in a human eye.

Before these issues began, I was wearing <a href="http://www.acuvue.com/acuvue2.htm">Acuvue 2</a> lenses. I experimented with the <a href="http://www.acuvue.com/acuvue_oasys.htm">Acuvue Oasys</a>, which was somewhat worse, and in between the two Acuvue brands I also experimented with <a href="http://www.nightandday.com/nightandday/index.jsp">CIBA Vision's Night &amp; Day</a> lenses, which were the worst of all.

In any case, I have been out of the loop with the current technology of contact lenses for a couple of years, and am wondering if there are any recent advances, perhaps even specifically for people who have experienced the issues that I have, who need computer friendly contact lenses. Certainly I plan to talk to the optometrist about this, but any other insights would be most welcome. Please feel free to comment.
