title: Adobe AIR Bus Tour
type: post
excerpt: Over the weekend, Adobe released the Beta version of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">AIR</a>, which I think is a worse name than Apollo was. Maybe they'll rename it before it comes out of Beta. Anyway, they've also announced a <a href="http://onair.adobe.com/">bus tour</a> across the United States to promote AIR.

Over the weekend, Adobe released the Beta version of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">AIR</a>, which I think is a worse name than Apollo was. Maybe they'll rename it before it comes out of Beta. Anyway, they've also announced a <a href="http://;onair.adobe.com/">bus tour</a> across the United States to promote AIR.

This free event will teach developers how to make AIR applications out of existing Flex, presumably Flash, or HTML/JavaScript applications. They've got food, drink, and lots of good information about designing applications that are freaking awesome.

I look forward to this event.
