<blockquote>
  <p>So I&rsquo;m not going to live trapped by fear of the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; decision anymore. I&rsquo;m not going to worry about ruining my life. My eyes, my ears, and my discernment may fail me at times, but if I&rsquo;m living in honest pursuit of Truth, I believe I&rsquo;ll find it.</p>
