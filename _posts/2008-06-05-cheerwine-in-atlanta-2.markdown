<p>I&#39;ve mentioned before that I grew up in the town of Salisbury, North Carolina. It is roughly 45 minutes north of Charlotte. One of the great, enduring things about Salisbury is a soda called <a href="http://www.cheerwine.com/">Cheerwine</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a great soda, and I always make sure to stock up when I visit my family in North Carolina. Essentially, it is very easy to find Cheerwine anywhere in North Carolina, and sometimes in South Carolina.</p>
<p>However, it is a very rare thing to find it outside the Carolinas. Today, I found it in a Kroger in Atlanta, and I was so excited I had to take a picture of it.</p>
<p>Ironically, we are leaving Atlanta on Sunday afternoon to travel to North Carolina.</p>
