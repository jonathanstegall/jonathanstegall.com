title: CSS Naked Day 2010
excerpt: "Today marks the second time (because it took me so long to design my website
  after I turned it into a blog) that I've celebrated <a href=\"http://naked.dustindiaz.com/\">CSS
  Naked Day</a>, which is a time for designers to remove styles from their websites,
  showing the underlying semantic HTML in all its glory.\r\n\r\nThe point of this
  has always been to show the point of and promote such semantic HTML and web standards
  by showing how they serve to organize a site's content before it is visually organized.
  This is an important reminder to those of us concerned with accessibility, search
  engine optimization, and the standards we're promoting."

Today marks the second time (because it took me so long to design my website after I turned it into a blog) that I've celebrated <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a>, which is a time for designers to remove styles from their websites, showing the underlying semantic HTML in all its glory.

The point of this has always been to show the point of and promote such semantic HTML and web standards by showing how they serve to organize a site's content before it is visually organized. This is an important reminder to those of us concerned with accessibility, search engine optimization, and the standards we're promoting.

Obviously, this isn't happening on any client sites, but it's appropriate to put on one's blog.
