Here’s another post on the divide that many folks believe is happening in the emerging church - between the Emergent folks, the missional folks, and this one adds the Neo-Reformed folks. I’m still saddened by the idea. It occurs to me that I’m saddened partly because this is a movement where I felt even folks like me who don’t know where to fit (aside from not being Neo-Reformed) might have a place, seeking the heart of God and sharpening one another. But regardless, this is a graceful post, and there are some great comments. One comforting line is this, “all these differences can only be worked out ON THE GROUND, in real life communities led by the Holy Spirit in the same way it always has.”
