Second part of a series that investigates solidarity and resistance in community. This part examines how easy it is to move into poor communities and do a few things without actually focusing on marginalized people in these communities, and yet still feel the right to be self-congratulatory. While I havenâ€™t yet done this kind of move (it compels me and will hopefully happen in the not-too-distant future), it is essential to remember that doing this must lead us to solidarity and mutual liberation.
