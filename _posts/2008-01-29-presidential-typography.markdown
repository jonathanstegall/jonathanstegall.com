Boston.com examines the typefaces used by the various presidential campaigns, and what those typefaces communicate. I love good typography. The web is plagued by abysmal typography, but there is a lot of evidence that many people, especially standards-aware designers, have really begun to care about this kind of thing.

Anyway. I think the article analyzes the various typefaces and what they represent very accurately. Worth a read.
