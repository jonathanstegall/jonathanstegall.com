Michael Wesch reflects, in light of the 20th anniversary of the public beginning of the web.




> Skills and information fade into obsolescence. They are the metaphorical fish handed to you by the guy who should have taught you how to fish. More importantly, skills and information alone do not help us lead happier, healthier, richer, more ethical and more meaningful lives. We need a vision for who we and our students need to *be* – not just what we should know.
