Brilliant explanation of why a vote for McCain will not overturn abortion or significantly reduce it, even in the event of anti Roe v Wade judge appointments. The vast majority of arguments against evangelicals voting for Obama boil down to abortion, which I want to come right out and say is not a valid argument. Republicans have used this issue as a smokescreen for years, and it is time to stop the minimization of morality that their pandering represents.
