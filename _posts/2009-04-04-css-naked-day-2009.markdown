Each year, there is an event participated in by many standards-aware web designers and developers, called [CSS Naked Day](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/). Essentially, it involves a single international day (48 hours, following all the time zones) in which participating sites deactivate their `CSS`, which removes all styling and leaves only the underlying markup.

It is described in this way:

> The idea behind this event is to promote Web Standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of (x)html, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good 'ol play on words. It's time to show off your `<body>`.

Enough said. I wanted to let you know that I'll be participating this year. I care deeply about beautiful, semantic code on the sites, and portions of sites, that I influence. I think this is a vital part of high quality, modern web design.
