Kathy Escobar gives some lovely ideas for Lent for folks with shifting faith, or who feel lost. Needed this.

> even though i am a person who enjoys this season for the most part, i notice that some of the stuff i read makes me cringe a little. it can feel so exclusive, only for a certain group who speaks a certain language. it can feel privileged, seemingly irrelevant to many people without resources or margin.  it can feel contrived, a little like christmas where there are actually 11 other months of the year where our hearts are supposed to be just as open to God and others.
