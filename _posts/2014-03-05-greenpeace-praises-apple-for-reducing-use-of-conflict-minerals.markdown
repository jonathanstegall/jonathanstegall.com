From Greenpeace (I'm late in linking to this, but Im so happy it's moving this way):

> Apple has flexed its muscles in the past to push suppliers to remove hazardous substances from products and provide more renewable energy for data centers, and it is proving the same model can work to reduce the use of conflict minerals.
