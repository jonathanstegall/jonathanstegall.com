A reminder that boycotting BP leaves you feeling good for buying gas from equally bad, if not as visible right now, other oil companies. “Just as buying green products is better for our eco-esteem than it is an effective way to save the planet, so consumer boycotts of the latest oil company to run afoul of public opinion are emotionally satisfying but ultimately futile.”
