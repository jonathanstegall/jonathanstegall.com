> And so we come to the crucial step, the one that most teams skip over and the reason why they end up in the “what ifs” and opinion wars: analysis. I’m not talking about group therapy, though some teams I’ve worked with could use some. Rather, the team now looks at the strength of the data to support design decisions. Without this step, it is far too easy to choose the wrong inference to direct the design decisions. You’re working from the gut, and the gut can be wrong.
