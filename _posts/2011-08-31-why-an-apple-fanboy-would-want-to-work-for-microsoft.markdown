> The central thesis of Bill Fultonâ€™s talk was that the perceived value of usability is what needs our attention. Instead of spreading usability department thin trying to fix whatever we can, Fulton recommends focusing our efforts on specific departments, projects, or sub-projects are the most receptive to usability recommendations and thus will produce high-impact results.
