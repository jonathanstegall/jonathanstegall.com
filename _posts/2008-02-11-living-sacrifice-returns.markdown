I have been a big fan of <a href="http://www.livingsacrifice.com/">Living Sacrifice</a>, roughly since I became a Christian. They put out amazing music with great lyrics and intense spirituality over a long period of time (approximately 16 years), and they seemed to be genuinely good guys. They were always willing to hang out and talk after shows, whether they were playing at <a href="http://www.cornerstonefestival.com/">big</a> <a href="http://www.myspace.com/milwaukeemetalfest">festivals</a> or <a href="http://www.cafejam.com/">little</a> <a href="http://www.statemedia.com/">venues</a>.

When I was a sophomore in high school, my dad took me to see them, which I'm assuming was his first metal show. Great times. He later took me to Cornerstone. Amazing times. My dad's an amazing guy like that. I took my youth pastor to see them once, too. He had seen AC/DC, though, among other things. Also good times.

Anyway. The point of all this is that <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=133593122&blogID=354819091">Living Sacrifice has reformed</a> after a three or four year hiatus, and will be touring and releasing a new album in 2008. Wonderful news.
