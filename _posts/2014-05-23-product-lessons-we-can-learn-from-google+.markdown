I've long been [a critic](http://jonathanstegall.com/2011/07/02/google-plus-and-design-as-problem-solving/) of Google+ as a product, especially from a user experience design perspective. I don't think Google did the hard work of figuring out the problems users had with social networking, but instead tried to figure out its own problems and build a product out of that. I still believe this, and it's rather validating to see one of the folks who worked on the original product echo some of what I said three years ago.
