Currently, I'm attending <a href="http://www.uxweek.com/">UX Week 2008</a> in San Francisco. Should you happen to be there, feel free to post a comment.

Anyway, as a brief update, we have this gem from <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/full-episodes/index.jhtml">Stephen Colbert</a>, regarding the issue of human rights violations in China:
<blockquote><p>What are they thinking doing it on their own soil? Isn't there an offshore military base they can use?</p></blockquote>
On a more serious note, I think it is incredibly important to be aware of the profundity that is in shows like <em>The Colbert Report</em>. When he says things like this, he is using the art of comedy to speak to us, and hopefully to evoke change.
