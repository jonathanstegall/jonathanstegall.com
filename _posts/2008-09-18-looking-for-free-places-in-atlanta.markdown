I'm hoping the blogosphere can help in a current search <a href="http://kierastegall.com/">my wife</a> and I have begun.

As I've mentioned, she is a <a href="http://candler.emory.edu/">graduate student</a>, and thus is very busy. She is also a fairly high-stress person, and thus being very busy and very stressed is an interesting combination for her.

When she gets stressed, she likes to get out of the house and have a place to sit. Naturally, this is one of the reasons that she loves coffeehouses. We both find them wonderful places to spend time, provided that they are local, independent coffeehouses. However, in order to spend time in a coffeehouse one has to spend some money. Thus, it is impractical to do on a daily or semi-daily basis when one is on a limited budget.

So our question is this: where do you go, away from your house, where you don't have to spend money and are able to hang out for a few hours? Maybe do some homework, or writing, or something similar? We'd love to get some ideas.
