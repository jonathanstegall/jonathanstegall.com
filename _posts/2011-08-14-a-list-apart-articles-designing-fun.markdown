> Fortunately, it’s possible to create designs that are ‘fun’ without resorting to the old ‘I’ll know it when I see it’ method. There will always be an element of subjectivity in designing fun, but by defining, researching, building, and measuring, we can develop a long-term approach for incorporating ‘fun’ into our designs. And maybe even have some fun in the process.
