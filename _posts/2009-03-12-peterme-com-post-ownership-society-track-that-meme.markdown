Fantastic article on post-ownership from a user experience design perspective. I see this as an area of great potential into which the church can emerge into something new, by reaching back to the book of Acts. I don’t know if it will do it, but imagine the reshaping that could happen! “One thing that’s clear is that the importance people associate with owning stuff will decrease. It will be supplanted by access, experiences, and the act of creation.”
