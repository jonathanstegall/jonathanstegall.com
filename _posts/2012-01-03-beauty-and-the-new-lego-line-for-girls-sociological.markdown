> So, basically, what Lego has done over the last few decades is take a  truly wonderful gender-neutral toy, infuse it with boyness, and tell every kid who’ll listen that the toy is not-for-girls. Now, stuck with only 50% of the kid market, they’re going after girls by overcompensating. And, to top it all off, they’re shaking their heads and doing ‘science’ to try to figure out girls, as if they’re some strange variant of human that regular humans just can’t get their head around.”
