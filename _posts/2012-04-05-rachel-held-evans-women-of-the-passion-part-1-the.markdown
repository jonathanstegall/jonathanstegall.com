> We cannot know for sure whether the woman who anointed Jesus saw her actions as a prelude to her teacher&rsquo;s upcoming death and burial. I suspect she knew instinctively, the way that women know these things, that a man who dines at a leper&rsquo;s house, who allows a woman to touch him with her hair, who rebukes Pharisees and befriends prostitutes, would not survive for long in the world in which she lived.
