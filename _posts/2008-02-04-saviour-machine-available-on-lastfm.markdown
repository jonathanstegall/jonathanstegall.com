As I've said, I spend a lot of time listening to music on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/flamingsole/">last.fm</a>. Especially at work. Previously, my favorite band, <a href="http://www.saviourmachine.com/">Saviour Machine</a>, was not available (thus, if you were listening to a last.fm stream in the player or on the site, you would never hear them).

Now, they are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Saviour+Machine/">up</a>. While digital music, and especially streaming digital music, is not yet of a high enough quality to give a full appreciation of Saviour Machine's music, it is still a wonderful thing. I encourage you to check them out.
