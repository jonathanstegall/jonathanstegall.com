So, I've finally made my new design live, as you can see. I hope you find it pleasant and fitting to its content.

All of the existing content has been given this new design, as there wasn't an "old design" with which the existing content fits. If you are looking for <a href="/daily-links/">daily links</a>, they are now exclusively in their own category. There is also a separate <a href="http://jonathanstegall.com/daily-links/feed/">feed</a> for them. If you'd rather not see the daily links in your feed, you can use <a href="http://jonathanstegall.com/posts/feed/">this feed</a> to only see posts. There is also a <a href="http://jonathanstegall.com/feed/">combined feed</a>.

So, without further ado, feel free to comment, ask questions, examine source code, and so on.
