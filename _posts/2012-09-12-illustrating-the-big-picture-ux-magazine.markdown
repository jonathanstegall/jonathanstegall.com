> Journey modeling is the process of illustrating a complete story centered on the relationship that unfolds over time between an individual and a system, service, product, brand, or organization. Through journey modeling, we describe what an individual thinks, feels, says, and does over time, and how these actions and reactions change based on the person’s interactions with the organization and factors that may be beyond the organization’s control. By playing out a user’s experience over time, we build an understanding of connectedness and causality, observing when various forces intersect and alter a person’s emotions, opinions, and actions.
