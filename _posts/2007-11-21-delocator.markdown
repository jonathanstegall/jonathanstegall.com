Today, I found [Delocator](http://www.delocator.net/), a site that locates non-corporate cafes, bookstores, and movie theaters based on one's zip code.

My wife and I are big fans of coffeeshops, and do everything we can to avoid the corporate ones for a variety of reasons. Because of this, we're aware of most of the listings for our area, but I can only imagine the usefulness of this service should we travel, or move, or whatever. Great stuff.
