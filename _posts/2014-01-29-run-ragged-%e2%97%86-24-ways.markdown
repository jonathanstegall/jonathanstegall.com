> We&rsquo;re told time and time again that as a person who makes websites we have to get comfortable with our lack of control. On the web, this is a feature, not a bug. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to lower our standards, or not strive for the same amount of typographic craft of our print-based cousins. We shouldn&rsquo;t leave good typesetting at the door because we can&rsquo;t control the line length.
