Interesting thoughts on the anti-globalization and “ultra-pro-free-market capitalism” extremes. Julie really indicates that it isn’t as simple as many of us who care about the poor and suffering sometimes make it. We act as though not buying things from China will help solve the problems that we have helped cause, and it doesn’t work that way.
