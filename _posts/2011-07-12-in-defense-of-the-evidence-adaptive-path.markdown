> Maybe we shouldn’t be borrowing from visual arts—photography, graphic design, illustration—by calling the artifacts of our work a “portfolio.” Possibly we need to frame them with more context and have case studies be our calling card. Or, simply, supporting artifacts, or evidence. Indeed, we shouldn’t limit these “portfolios” to neat and tidy wireframes, interfaces, and flows. They should include images of sticky note-filled walls and whiteboards, sketches, and research protocols. I know that I would never hire someone who didn’t have some visual supporting evidence of his or her work.
