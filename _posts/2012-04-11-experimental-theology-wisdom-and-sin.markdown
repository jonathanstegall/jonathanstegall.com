> There are times when the &lsquo;is a sin&rsquo;/&rsquo;isn&rsquo;t a sin&rsquo; binary judgment is the best way to answer the question. But life is so complex and the Christian ethical witness so diverse that at times it&rsquo;s a struggle to give a definitive answer. And it&rsquo;s at these times where I find the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament to be a better framing than the Protestant worry about escaping the wrath of an angry God.
