More public documentation of the design process for “Reading is Fundamental.” Essentially, the first time they tried designing a series of full templates, indicating full page layouts at different sizes and so on. Most designers have done this. But in their case, it didn’t work and they went to a more elemental approach: designing specific parts, like the header, the footer, some interior page components, etc.

This is far more common among UX folks and larger sites than it is strictly visual designers and smaller projects, but I’m thrilled to see someone document it in this context. It’s often hard for me to explain why we should do it like this.
