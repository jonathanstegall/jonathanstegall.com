From Jared Spool:





> 
  
> 
> Teams employing paper prototyping and Agile development are showing a bias for making. Instead of waiting for the plan, they start building something. They know that what they’re making is likely to be wrong, but that doesn’t stop them.
> 
> 
  
  
> 
> A bias for making doesn’t mean the team never plans. On the contrary, plans happen fluidly throughout the entire design process. The difference is they are evolving as the team learns from the process of making.
