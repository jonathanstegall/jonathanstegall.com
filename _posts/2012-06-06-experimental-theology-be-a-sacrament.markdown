> First, it means that Chris­tians in the world should be signs of grace. In a world gov­erned by death and ruled by the prin­ci­pal­i­ties and pow­ers Chris­tians should be sacraments—visible signs of res­ur­rec­tion, love, free­dom, life and grace. 
> 
> Sec­ond, Chris­tians in the world should be effi­ca­cious signs of grace. Inso­far as we are able we should bring res­ur­rec­tion, love and grace into the lives of oth­ers by mak­ing our­selves avail­able to the world in the midst of death’s works.
