For everyone who uses PayPal and/or eBay: the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/securitykey">PayPal Security Key</a>.
<blockquote><p>It's a device that generates a temporary 6-digit security code every 30 seconds. Use it every time you log in for added security.</p></blockquote>
Brilliant idea, and one that really shows that ebay/PayPal are really taking security seriously, regardless of issues they have had in the past. I feel much better about using their services. In addition to this, this device is developed by <a href="http://www.verisign.com/">VeriSign</a>, who is used by approximately everyone. It could only be a good thing if more ecommerce sites and shoppers began to use this device.
