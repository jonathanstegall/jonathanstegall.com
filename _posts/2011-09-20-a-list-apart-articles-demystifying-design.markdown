> Mystifying design with jargon only we understand makes us feel like heroes and creates a sense of job security. But it also creates an "us and them" atmosphere which excludes non-designers, obscures the true value of design, and generates antagonism when only cooperation will yield the best product. By revealing our process and inviting others into our world, we can create a team that is invested in the success of our work, and deliver better design.
