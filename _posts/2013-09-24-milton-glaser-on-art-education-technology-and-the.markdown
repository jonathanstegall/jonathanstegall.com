Milton Glaser reflects on education and mentoring. "… it was a profound example of somebody - an adult, authority figure, sophisticated man - who was willing to put aside his own desire for something, his own direction for my life, and recognize me as a person who had made a decision… encouraging it with this incredibly gracious and generous gift."
