## Design

I work at Emory University, where I work on websites for clients across the university. I focus on advocating for and implementing beautiful, user-centered designs, though I also write a lot of code. From time to time I do these things on freelance projects as well. You can [read more about this](/work/).

This site has existed since 2006 when it was just a portfolio and had replaced various sites I'd maintained since 1997. These days it's mostly a blog. I've designed and built a couple of WordPress themes for it, including this one.

## Theology

I have an abiding love for theology, and one of my long-term goals is to work on the integration of design and theology. The first way to do that is, of course, to be really good at both and keep getting better. Sometimes I write about these things. My own thought has been especially impacted by Pentecostalism, counterculture movements, Celtic theology, Anabaptism, and liberation theology.

I'm drawn to following God and working out my theology in the way of Jesus, and I love to do it together with other folks. I try to do it online through Twitter, blogs, podcasts, and so on, and through local communities of faith. They feed each other.

## Justice

Cornel West says that "justice is what love looks like in public." I don't mind charity, but it's no substitute for justice [^1]. I look for ways to orient my life toward liberation for both the oppressed and the oppressors, in big things like understanding and dealing with my own privilege and in the everyday issues of what kind of coffee I drink.

[^1]: I'm indebted to Augustine of Hippo, and more recently [Sarah Kendzior](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/12/charity-not-substitute-justice-201312173423540217.html), for this saying.
