Part six of a series examining our fascination with pirates, and what it means for our faith. This one examines the ways in which the heresy proclaimed by pirates becomes the orthodoxy that we need, which later again needs to be critiqued by the pirate heretics. I didn’t link to the series as it was being written, like I should have, so it’s all here at once - on Talk Like A Pirate Day!
