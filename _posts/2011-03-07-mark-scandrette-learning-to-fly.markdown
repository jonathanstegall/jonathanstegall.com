> I believe there are lessons we simply can’t learn about life in God’s kingdom by being cautious. We must throw ourselves into challenging and overwhelming situations that take us beyond ourselves. But once we’ve gone over the edge, we have to learn how to fly by finding balance and flow– spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially and relationally. Our faith-inspired activism has to grow into a substantive and sustaining rhythm of life that engages struggle without becoming jaded or embittered.
