There is a great program for bloggers through <a href="http://www.theooze.com/">The Ooze</a> called <a href="http://viralbloggers.com/">TheOOZE Viral Bloggers</a>, through which bloggers can review books. It seems to be wonderful, both for bloggers and authors.

Through this program, I just received <a href="http://viralbloggers.com/2009/05/a-people%E2%80%99s-history-of-christianity-by-diana-butler-bass/">A People&rsquo;s History of Christianity</a> by Diana Butler Bass. I'm reading this right now, and will blog about it shortly. In the meantime, though, feel free to <a href="http://theooze.tv/thinkfwd/diana-butler-bass-a-peoples-history-of-christianity">watch this OOZE.tv interview</a> with Diana, where she discusses the book.

I'm really looking forward to this, and have thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of chapters. This is the kind of church history book that I want, to a large extent. It is hard to study church history, but it is even harder to see how little the church today knows about church history. Most of us know almost nothing about the movement of Jesus throughout the ages, and this is why she can call it "The Other Side of the Story."

I normally don't post videos here, but would like to go ahead and post this one for you to watch, if you like. Enjoy.
