Mark continues the series on the connections between Christianity and Empire. This one considers the notion of the supremacy of Christianity, and the short leaps that are made from that to supremacy of nations, races, and so on. Mark suggests that we are faithful instead by servanthood, humility, and inferiority. The series will continue from here, and I’m really anticipating where he’ll go.
