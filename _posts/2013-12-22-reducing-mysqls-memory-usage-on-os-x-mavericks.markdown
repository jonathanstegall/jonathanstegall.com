  <p>Recently, I found myself re-installing everything from Homebrew and began to notice that MySQL was consuming nearly half a gig of memory. Given that I don&rsquo;t do too much with MySQL on a regular basis, I opted to override a handful of default configuration options to reduce the memory footprint.</p>
