Three lessons for living a good life. I found it truly fascinating that this was posted on Harvard Business Review. Anyway, they are: Cultivate (your better self). Create (something dangerous). Forgive (and fail). The last one, especially, shook me a bit. I’m only 28, but sometimes I feel like the directions I wanted to go are impossible because I didn’t realize where my choices would, in fact, lead.
