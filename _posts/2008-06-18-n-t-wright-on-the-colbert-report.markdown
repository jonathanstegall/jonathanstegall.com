Interesting news. <a href="http://www.ntwrightpage.com/">N. T. Wright</a> will be on <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/index.jhtml">The Colbert Report</a> tomorrow night, Thursday June 19. <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/full-episodes/index.jhtml">Full episodes</a> are available the day after the show airs.

<a href="http://kierastegall.com/">My wife</a> and I have not had cable since we've been married. For years, I've wished that I could have <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/">Cartoon Network</a>, <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/">Comedy Central</a>, and <a href="http://nick.com/">Nickelodeon</a> without having to buy other channels that I don't need.

Now, though, the recent addition of full episodes of The Colbert Report and <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a> allows us to watch all of the shows we like online.
