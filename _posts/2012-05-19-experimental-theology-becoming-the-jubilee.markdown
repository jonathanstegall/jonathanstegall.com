> All this makes sense if Jesus is, in his very person, the Jubilee. Forgiveness&#8212;releasing those in debt&#8212;is what the Jubilee was all about. To experience the Jubilee is to have your debts forgiven. And that&#8217;s what Jesus did wherever he went. He brought the Jubilee. Jesus was the Jubilee.
> 
> And not just any Jubilee&#8212;it was and is the last, greatest and final Jubilee. The seventy times seven Jubilee.
> 
> And what is extraordinary about all this is that Jesus invites Peter&#8212;and you and I&#8212;to become the Jubilee as well.
