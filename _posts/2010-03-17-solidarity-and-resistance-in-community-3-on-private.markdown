Third part of a series that investigates solidarity and resistance in community. This part examines the concept of private property, and what kind of effects it can have on people and what should be done about it. I’m not sure that I agree with any of the options that are put forth, but it’s the kind of language that can cause us to think, and I do agree that this is necessary.
