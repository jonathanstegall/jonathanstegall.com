> WordPress does an excellent job highlighting current standard posts, pages or taxonomies when you include them in a navigation menu. But when you create a custom post or custom taxonomy everything goes wrong and the navigation stops highlighting the current page. Fortunately there is a workaround, you can manually specify which menu element highlights when you are showing custom content.
