<a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart - for people who make websites</a>, will be in downtown Chicago at the end of this month. And, so will I. If you'll be in the area and would like to have a coffee or something, post a comment. I've never been to a web related conference. Exciting stuff...
