> I dream of the day when working people all over join hands and with peace and love in our hearts refuse to participate in a system that is so opposed to our own interests. I long for a mass movement of non-violent resistance dedicated to healthy communities, a healthy planet and an economic system based on the needs of creation, not the wants of materialism. These are the people and ideals that put President Obama in office and he seems to have forgotten. I donâ€™t mind standing in the rain for these ideals.
