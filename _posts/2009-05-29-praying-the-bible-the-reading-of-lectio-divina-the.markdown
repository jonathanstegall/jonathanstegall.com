The reading of lectio divina. “There’s no secret formula to the first step of lectio divina, but it’s a bit like savoring that one bite of food. Just read the passage slowly and repeatedly. Let it sink in. Read it out loud, and read it silently. Become familiar with the rhythms of the text, its ebbs and flows. Read it over and over again.”
