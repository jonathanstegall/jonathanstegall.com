Mike Clawson reflects upon why he is not leaving Emergent, in light of all the recent posts of people leaving. I’m in much the same boat, personally. I’m not in a liberal seminary (or any seminary) like he is, but my wife is at Emory, and he’s right that most Emergent theology is not on the liberal side.
