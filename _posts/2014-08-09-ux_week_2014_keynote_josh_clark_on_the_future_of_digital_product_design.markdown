> I think it’s really important to remember that the software is ideological. There are politics to software, in terms of the values and biases that you embed into it. And in a business where we design and shape paths of behavior, it’s important to acknowledge what those values are, so we can be conscious of it as much as possible. I think that as much as you can keep your eyes open to understand what those motivations and agendas are, the better served you’ll be. I think there’s a natural human impulse to assume that our initial guess was right, and so we’re sometimes blind to our own agendas or biases.
