> A couple of years ago I wrote about how I had a bit of a parental freak-out moment when my daughter turned 9 and I realized she was halfway to moving out and going to college. So like any lunatic person, I began giving her regular advice sermons at every possible juncture. Poor, poor child. I even named it Project 9 and made it a diary/journal of sorts for her to have. Well now we’re in Project 1o (Egad! Eight years left!) and I thought I’d share one of the more frequent soapbox sermons I’ve imparted to her this year.
