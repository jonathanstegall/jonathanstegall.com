I've noticed that, interestingly enough, my most visited post for this entire year is <a href="http://jonathanstegall.com/2008/05/26/sharing-a-filezilla-profile/">this one</a> on how to share a <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> profile, in which I showed how to use the same FTP profile with my Linux system and my Windows system.

This particular knowledge has proven to be invaluable to me. Being a designer who works in both operating systems, it is a lifesaver to be able to access the same FTP data on both automatically.

But I'm curious: if you came here through that post, did you learn what you wanted to learn? FileZilla is a powerful program as far as FTP clients go, and I won't pretend to know everything about it. However, if there is something that you are seeking that leads you here and you are not finding it, please leave a comment. I may be able to help a bit.
