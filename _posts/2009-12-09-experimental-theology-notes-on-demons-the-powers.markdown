I havenâ€™t linked to all the posts in this series, but they are all worth a read. I disagree to an extent, i that I do actually believe that angels and demons are real beings as well as the essence of institutions, but I can still completely respect the admonition to unite the material and spiritual as the writers of Scripture did, that these posts give us. This one, especially, has powerful thoughts on what the role of the church toward the powers should be, and I think it applies regardless.
