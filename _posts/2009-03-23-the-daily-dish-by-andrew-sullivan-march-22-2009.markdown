And it has clearly helped delegitimize Christianity in the eyes of many who might otherwise be tempted to look at the Gospels in a more open-minded fashion. The damage these fanatics and reactionaries have done to actual faith - let alone a rational politics - is incalculable, and I’m damned if I will allow them to use the word "Christian" to describe their agenda. It isn’t.
