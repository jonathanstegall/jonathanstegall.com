Collaboration in Mozilla Bespin. I haven’t been interested in Bespin up to this point, but seeing this article on the possibilities for collaboration on code makes it interesting. For projects where Subversion (or other version control) is overkill or not possible (for technical reasons, or people reasons), this could be a lifesaver.
