> Rather than focusing on participation in the halls of political power (be it governmental or denominational), or evangelism among the corporate and academic elite, the church should focus on becoming a “wild space” on the margins of the dominant culture. In these wild spaces we could develop the skills to live lives that don’t fit societal stereotypes or conventions.
