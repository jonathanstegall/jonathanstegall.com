From John Frazee, in _The Journal of Irreproducible Results_:





> When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands with the buttered side down. I propose to strap buttered toast to the back of a cat; the 2 will hover, inches above the ground. With a giant buttered-cat array, a high-speed monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.





Because it is too many letters for Twitter, I thought this was worth posting.
