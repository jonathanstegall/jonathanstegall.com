There has recently been a bit of talk surrounding a <a href="http://blog.faithinpubliclife.org/upload/2008/09/FPL%20Mercer%20Torture%20Poll%20Memo%20Final-no%20embargo.pdf">poll</a> by Faith in Public Life and Mercer University. The results of this poll indicate that almost 60% of white evangelicals in the South believe that torture is often or sometimes justified. This is <em>more</em> than the percentage (48%) of the general public who believe the same.

Take a moment and read that again.

Now. Does that hurt? When I was in <a href="http://www.seuniversity.edu/">college</a>, I had a professor who would tell us to
<blockquote><p>Take on the pain of the world each day.</p></blockquote>
Take a moment, and take on the pain of the people that we have hurt, and will continue to hurt. Do you see the power of this kind of thought? We have nothing to say if we will not take on the pain of the Other, whoever the Other may be.
