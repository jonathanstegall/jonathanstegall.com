If you are in Atlanta and are available this afternoon at 5pm, the <a href="http://atlantaemergence.blogspot.com/">Atlanta Emergent Cohort</a> is doing an Ash Wednesday performance art ritual. Specifically, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_mob">flash mob</a>.

If you'd like to see an example of a flash mob, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo">this one</a> in New York's Grand Central Station.

Ours will take place at Atlanta's 5 Points MARTA station, which is basically the center of Atlanta. We have some ashes, and we'll have a five minute Requiem, and the public will be invited to, with the ashes, make the sign of the Cross on each other's foreheads. Then, we will disappear.

You can learn more about this at the <a href="https://atlritual.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.
