I've been ranting about academics and theology and all those things the last few days. I have often had the fear of becoming overly academic and forgetting to actually do anything. In light of this, I want to quote <a href="http://www.shermankuek.net/">Sherman on the Mount</a>, who <a href="http://www.shermankuek.net/2007/11/bedtime_story.php">says it</a> much better than I do:
<blockquote><p>When we philosophise our concepts of the Christian faith and try to work it out within the church and seminary walls, it's called "theology". When we work these out beyond the church and seminary walls, it's called "charity". When both are so integrated that they are expressed as a way of life, it's called spirituality.</p></blockquote>
