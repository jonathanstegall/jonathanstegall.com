<p>Recently, I got an invite to <a href="http://www.flixster.com/">Flixster</a>, which apparently is a movie review sharing website. I have been a member of <a href="http://www.revish.com/">Revish</a>, which is a site for sharing book reviews, since it began. It's very nice, in its design and its functionality and everything. A pleasure to use.</p>

<p>Flixster sent the first invite, and I ignored it. Then, it send another one. Not wanting to be annoyed with multiple invites, I accepted it. Like most websites with a social networking vein, it then asked me for my email details. I'm usually fine with this, as I can see if any of my contacts are part of the service already so I can add them. I almost never send invites to people if they are not already part of whatever service it is.</p>

<p>Flixster did show me the people who were already members, and had their names checked so I could add them. I clicked OK, but then I scrolled down and noticed that <em>all of my contacts</em> were also checked, and would get an invite from me. <em>Every</em> other site I've ever joined has had this as an "opt-in" feature, where you have to check those contacts manually.</p>

<p>All of them. Facebook. MySpace (!). Last.fm. Revish. Delicious. Twitter. Crowdvine. You name it.</p>

<p>So. I sent two useless emails to a couple hundred contacts, to whom I would normally never send useless emails. Many of them are very busy people who get lots of emails. I hate useless email, and I try to be careful with the emails that I send in order to maintain a proper relationship with people that I can only reach through email.</p>

<p>In light of this, there is an obvious lesson for designers of registration forms. If you have a social part of your registration process, DO NOT EVER make it an opt-out feature to automatically send invites to people that are not already members. EVER.</p>

<p>Because of this, Flixster will be on a black list for me, as a matter of principle and advocacy for good design and user experience. I have a passion for these things, and do not want to support sites that have such a flagrant disregard for them. Struggle with them is okay. Expected. But flagrant disregard, to an extent that is worse than anyone else in your field is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Do not use it. Use Facebook. Use anything else. Just not Flixster. If you happened to be on my contact list, and got an email before I clicked Stop, please accept my apologies.</p>
