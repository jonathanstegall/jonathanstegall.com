I have rarely reach such a powerful, sweeping piece on race in America. It cuts to the core of what makes the country what it is and how much we have entrenched ourselves in white supremacy and theft from black people like nothing I've read in a long time. It's worth a read, whatever awards it might get, and a national conversation that I imagine we are too racist to have , but I wish we weren't.
