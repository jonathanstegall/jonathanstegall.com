> Someone frames a design problem. They assemble a team of designers, developers, and product managers. Each team member individually brainstorms ideas. Each, then, shares his ideas with the group, which offers criticism and feedback. After more rounds of individual brainstorming and group discussion, a smaller team takes the resulting ideas and produces a final design.
