I’m gradually reading up on this whole Lean UX thing. While at times I don’t think it’s different from "good UX," at times the model they present and the specific methods are really helpful.

This one is one of those, especially with the way it talks about integrating usability testing.

Where I think this particular one falls apart is that design and development aren’t going on simultaneously. I think that’s something that responsive design requires.
