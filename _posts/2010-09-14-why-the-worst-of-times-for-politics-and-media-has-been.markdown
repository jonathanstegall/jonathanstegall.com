There’s a great profile of Jon Stewart and the Daily Show. Brilliant quote from Stewart near the end: “But I know the difference between real social change and what we do. You know what we are? Soil enrichers. Maybe we can add a little fertilizer to the soil so that real people can come along and grow things.”
