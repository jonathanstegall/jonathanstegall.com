Lately, I've really gotten into one of the songs that it plays from the new <a href=\"http://www.purevolume.com/hastetheday\">Haste the Day</a> album, Pressure the Hinges. I'm not a big fan of most of the album, as they've moved too far in an emo direction for me to like it, but the song <em>Chorus of Angels</em> blows me away."

I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/flamingsole/">Last.fm</a> music site. I listen to it all day at work. Lately, I've really gotten into one of the songs that it plays from the new <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/hastetheday">Haste the Day</a> album, Pressure the Hinges. I'm not a big fan of most of the album, as they've moved too far in an emo direction for me to like it, but the song <em>Chorus of Angels</em> blows me away.

As a unified piece; music, vocals, and lyrics, I feel that this song is an example of the best of what metalcore has to offer as a genre. I feel that there's a passion and a voice in it that marks the point where metalcore takes hold of its potential to make a powerful statement and connect with the listener in a significant way. The creativity that's there is an inspiration.

I love metalcore, but the fact is that the genre is oversaturated and doesn't live up to this potential as a whole. There are <a href="http://www.normajeannoise.com/">several</a> <a href="http://www.thechariot.com/">great</a> <a href="http://www.becomingthearchetype.com/">bands</a> that <a href="http://www.augustburnsred.com/">shatter</a> that overall tendency and consistently release songs of this caliber that connect with me in powerful ways, but I wanted to mention Chorus of Angels as it's been showing up on my Last.fm stream a lot recently.
