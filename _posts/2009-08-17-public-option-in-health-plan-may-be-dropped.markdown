While I am an advocate for a public option, this co-op option is interesting. It is especially interesting in light of the actions of people like Shane Claiborne in their own pursuits of healthcare for the poor and marginalized. I hope we hear more about this, but I do hope the decision is not yet made. That being said, Democrats are pathetically squandering their majority, and it is disgusting.
