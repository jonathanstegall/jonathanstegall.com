> There is a double standard in this society that women don’t deserve to be 'treated like a lady' if they don’t 'act like a lady.' However, men can apparently dress, act, say whatever they like with no negative repercussions. I am not even sure what the phrase, 'treated like a lady' means, but I think it means treated with respect…which should be granted to people of BOTH sexes…because we are humans. We are all part of this human race together. We all deserve love and respect.
