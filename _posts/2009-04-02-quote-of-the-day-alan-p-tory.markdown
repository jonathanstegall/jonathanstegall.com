Occasionally, I run into quotes that are utterly amazing, but are too long for Twitter. For now, since it doesn't happen that often, I'll post them here. From Alan P. Tory:

> There is a contemplative in all of us, almost strangled but still alive, who craves quiet enjoyment of the Now, and longs to touch the seamless garment of silence which makes whole.
