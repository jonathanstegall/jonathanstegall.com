> i was thinking yesterday how the world doesn’t need more "strong men who can lead and take control". the world needs more "strong, kind men who can love deeply & passionately & freely", who are willing to risk their time and heart and egos and pride to love their families–both biological & adopted–through little-pockets-of-love.
