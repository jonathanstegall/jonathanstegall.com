So, I've just recently finished a nice freelance project that allowed me to create an admin system from scratch. I used PHP/MySQL, and rather enjoyed myself learning a lot of things I didn't know about admin systems. I've created a couple in the past, but never one this object oriented, or this efficient, or this powerful. So I enjoyed it, and hope it gets approved by the client. Anyway.

As I've noted in other posts, I'm fairly close to finishing the Underground Railroad's redesign, and then I'll be able to work on other things. The Underground Railroad needs to be done by <a href="http://www.cornerstonefestival.com/">Cornerstone</a>, at the end of this month. It has a decent amount of work remaining, but I feel pretty confident I can get it done in time. It also is using PHP/MySQL, but is quite a bit more intensive, object oriented, and powerful than the admin system, simply because it's an entire site from the ground up, rather than just the admin system.

One of the other things I intend to turn to upon finishing this, <em>other than designing a theme for this blog</em>, is learning Ruby/Ruby on Rails. I've debated with myself about whether I want to learn Ruby, Python, ColdFusion, or try to learn .net in a better way than I did in college. I feel strongly that I didn't learn the best way of doing things that .net has to offer... whether that's wishful thinking or not is yet to be seen.

Don't get me wrong; I don't feel that it was the fault of the professor so much as the curriculum, as it was evolving after she took it over, and certainly did improve drastically from the point it was before she took it. Anyway. I'm not ready to deal with .net stuff again at the moment, if I ever will be, and ColdFusion is interesting, but I'm not sure where its future will take it. So, my major decision has been between Ruby and Python. I'm still not entirely decided, but I'm leaning toward Ruby.

I've found this <a href="http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/">hilarious guide</a> to Ruby, and it looks like something I could enjoy working through. It has funny language, funny drawings, and appears to be teaching in a way that is easy to follow while actually learning some things about the language. So, I look forward to working through this.
